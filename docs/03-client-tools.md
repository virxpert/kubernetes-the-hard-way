# Installing the Client Tools

First identify a system from where you will perform administrative tasks, such as creating certificates, kubeconfig files and distributing them to the different VMs.

If you are on a Linux laptop, then your laptop could be this system. In my case I chose the master-1 node to perform administrative tasks. Whichever system you chose make sure that system is able to access all the provisioned VMs through SSH to copy files over.

## Access all VMs

Generate Key Pair on master-1 node
`$ssh-keygen`

Leave all settings to default.

View the generated public key ID at:

```
$cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD......8+08b vagrant@master-1
```

Move public key of master to all other VMs

```
$cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys <<EOF
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD......8+08b vagrant@master-1
EOF
```


## Install kubectl

The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl). command line utility is used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server. Download and install `kubectl` from the official release binaries:

Reference: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Linux

```
curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

```
chmod +x kubectl
```

```
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verification

Verify `kubectl` version 1.19.0 or higher is installed:

```
kubectl version --client
```

> output

```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19", GitVersion:"v1.19.0", GitCommit:"e19964183377d0ec2052d1f1fa930c4d7575bd50", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-08-26T14:30:33Z", GoVersion:"go1.15", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
